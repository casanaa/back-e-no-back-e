# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
As a manager at an internet retail company

I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

So that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL 
password to an environment variable file

Then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

When I enter schema and seed commands

Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

Then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
